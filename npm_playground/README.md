# NPM Playground

Playground for exploring our created npm components. There should only be a single code file here, and that is `App.js`. All modules should be downloaded from npm to ensure they work.

Note: this is also useful because there are known material-ui issues (https://material-ui.com/getting-started/faq/#i-have-several-instances-of-styles-on-the-page) that arise when there's multiple material-ui copies installed (which is the case in the components development directories) and so this playground allows us to test those components in isolation without that issue.
